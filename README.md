### What Goes into a README?

This README should serve as a template for your own- go through the important
files in your project and describe what they do. Each file that you edit
(you can ignore your migration files) should get at least a paragraph. Each
function should get a small blurb.

You should describe your application first, and with a good level of
detail. The rest should be ordered by importance to the user. (Probably
routes next, then models.)
